It's fairly common in film cameras to have an interchangable film back. This is a part of the camera that carries the film in whatever format and is swappable on the camera.

This adds an additional layer of modularity to the effort of making a 3d printed film camera.

Common Backs:
- Mamiya RB67
- Mamiya Press M back
- Hasselblad V
- Bronica ETR
- Pentax 645
- Mamiya 645
- Graflok compatible backs
- Custom backs
